KFDA has developed a comprehensive multi-tenant web platform to distribute Fil+ datacap to general public. This platform will provide each client with a dedicated workspace where they can invite collaborators, create a dataset onboarding plan, upload metadata, and monitor the data verification process. Additionally, it will enable clients to apply for subsequent allocation tranches and submit disputes, among other functionalities, thereby streamlining the data management and verification process for each client.
